During the first week, there was orientation day as well as a series of workshops. Students were placed in a specific workshop based off of their score on the placement test. Overall I placed well on the test, so I was put into Python 102. In that workshop we worked on making dictionaries and editing them. During week one, I met with my faculty and grad mentor to discuss what our project is and what is expected of me as a research intern. I can say that I am excited to dive into the project. 

During the workshops that were held this week, we covered a lot. I learned how to build a machine learning model that tests data using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. I also learned how to do numpy and pandas. Some frustrations I ran into while learning about Numpy and Pandas is that to delete, assert, and modify information, there are functions that work for Numpy that doesn't work for Pandas and vice versa. I am very proud of myself for staying focused and following along to the best of my ability. I feel that I have learned new skills that will help me advance in my career
