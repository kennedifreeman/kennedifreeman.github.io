## About Me
Hello, my name is Kennedi Freeman. I am a Senior at Morgan State University, located in Baltimore, Maryland. I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Systems with a minor in Computer Science. My expected graduation date is in May 2025. My plans post-graduation is to immediately find work in the cybersecurity field. To start out I want to be a cybersecurity analyst, and then eventually go into ethical hacking, forensics, or penetration testing. During my senior year, I also plan to take two compTIA exams; the CompTIA Security + and the compTIA CYSA + to help me reach my career goals post- graduation.
