During week 5 of the internship, I started doing more hands on work. I was able to build my VM using UTM, Ubuntu, and Linux. It is now up and running and able to hold my data files. I was also able to preprocess my data. So now, the data is cleaned and the only thing that is left to do for the dataset is to complete the feature reduction. After this, the challenge will be to transfer my ML model over from my personal laptop to my VM. Overall, I am excited about my project and can't wait until it is up and running. Unlike the previous weeks, we did not go on a field trip. I believe this week was meant to focus on our projects and catch up from the weeks where we did have field trips.
