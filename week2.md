During week 2 I read articles on Cyberattack attempts on navigation systems. I have also done lit review research on cyberattacks to compare how different scientists have chosen their features as well as the Machine Learning models they have used. The team and I also had the chance to go over a more in depth summary of the project with Dr. Cole. During our meeting we talked about what is expected from each intern and the deadlines we have to work with. On thursday during our meeting, we talked to Ms. Anita about published articles and how the goal is to get our work published and be able to host presentations on it.
