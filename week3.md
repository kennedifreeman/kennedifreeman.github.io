During week 3 the group and I had a meeting with our mentor and advisor to conversate about the next steps in the project. We are to agree on which cyberattack to use as well as the ML models. During this process I have learned so much about the different ML models there are and what some of them are used for. Next week I am looking forward to building the ML model and implementing the datasets. On Wednesday, there was a presentation held by Prof. Gloria Washington. The presentation was about AAVE and how there is a lack of it in devices such as: Siri, Alexa, and etc. I enjoyed it very much and would love to see her present again during the program. On thursday, the program took a field trip to the John's Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL) where we were given a tour. My favorite stop that we made while on the tour was learning about "spot", the robot dog that is built to help official while they are out on duty.
