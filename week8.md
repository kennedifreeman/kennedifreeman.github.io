Week 8 for me was not very eventful. My project is working on being able to detect DDOS attacks. Within this project, I have had many struggles and set backs. Some of them have been obtaining papers that are not serving a purpose to me. This resulted in me having to start my project over. Another struggle I've had is working with my dataset. My dataset has over 600,000 cell in it that are filled with data. With the dataset being so big, it continued to crash on my computer due to there not being enough space. My computer is not the only I've tried to work on though, even the computer my mentor gave to me won't work with this datset. Overall, I feel like I have learned a lot throughout this process, but I am sad and disappointed that I couldln't get the project to work before the deadline.
