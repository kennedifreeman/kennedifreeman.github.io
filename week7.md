Week 7 was exciting. I was able to finally find code that worked for my feature extraction  using RFE (Recursive Feature Extarction) with the help of another member in the cohort. This now puts in the space where I can work on my ML model and plug in the datasets. Along with that, the team and I had our mid-summer presnetations where we explained the progress of our projects to the other memebers. Everyone did well on their presentations and I can't wait to see the final product. Next week, I am looking forward to working with my ML model as well as starting the paper.
