Week 6 was a little slower than the previous weeks. I am still in the preprecessing of data phase in my project. The challenge that I am having with this at the moment is that fitting my data into RFE (Recursive Feature Extraction) which is data feature extraction. There is an error that keeps popping up explaing that the reason my data is not able to be fit is because the column 'label' can't be found. So therefore this weekend I will be trying to finish those steps. This week there was also a town hall meeting held where the undergrad researchers were able to voice their concerns with the program so far. Next week I am looking forward to implementing the data into the machine learning model as well as writing a portion of the paper.
