During week 4 a lot was accomplished. The cohort took a a field trip to NASA here in Maryland, where we got the chance to take a tour and learn more about what work they do at that specific location. As far as my project goes, I have definitely made a good bit of progress. I have sucessfully found a vm software that is compatible with my computer. The one that I use is UTM and Ubuntu. I have built my own vm UTM and Ubuntu with Linux to be able to import my datasets while still protecting my computer from possibly being attacked. I have also finished reading and dissecting my articles to find and implement classifiers into my model. The only thing I am waiting for at the moment is to obtain a dataset so I can test and train it.
