Week 10 is the last week of the internship. During this week we are instructed to put together a final presentation to show the rest of the interns. We also continued to work on our final literature review papers. The teacher, Mrs. Ross-Jones helped us with the presentation as well as the paper. So for that, I am very thankful. After we finished the presentation, we needed to practice, so we did. We did this to try and make sure we stayed within a certain time limit for our presentation and to make sure we flowed correctly. During presentation day, we watched each group go up and give their presentation. Everyone did really good and I can tell each intern learned something during their time in the program. If I am being honest, I do feel like my grouos presentation could've been better, but I believe we struggled with having a clear understanding the whole time and it affected our presentation.
