Week 9 for me still was not as eventful as I thought it would be. During this week, I had a meeting with my mentor and teammates to discuss the format of our paper and what tasks need to be delegated. Since we all are working on individual attacks and machine learning models, we need to contribute our own words to each secction of the paper. I am facing challenges when it comes to the discussion part of the paper because my project isn't necessarily complete. For my algoriths and classifiers, I am supposed to use RFE, Adaboost, and XGboost. The only ones I were able to use before the deadline were XGboost and RFE( Recursive Feature Elimination) using Random Forest. Hopefully the team and I will be able to make the paper flow. Mr. Zaman has been very helpful through this process of writing the paper and is making sure the layout is correct.
